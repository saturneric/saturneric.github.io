        <h1 id="My-thoughts-on-the-IoT-2"><a href="#My-thoughts-on-the-IoT-2" class="headerlink" title="My thoughts on the IoT 2"></a>My thoughts on the IoT 2</h1><p>The previous article roughly talked about the germination of the idea of decentralization of the Internet of Things in my mind. This week I further thought about the germination of my heart. Now, I mainly want to elaborate on the conceptual framework in my mind. There may be some omissions and hopes.</p>
<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>This article mainly summarizes my decentralized view of the Internet of Things and the main organizational form of the public network of the Internet of Things after decentralization. For everyone’s easy acceptance, don’t be bothered by the boring logical thinking in my mind. I gave some examples to illustrate. This has lost some professionalism and hopes for understanding.</p>
<h2 id="Thoughts"><a href="#Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Thoughts"></a>Thoughts</h2><p>In my vision, the objects connected to the Internet of Things are equal. They all have their own functions, such as boiling water, cooking rice, making yogurt (maybe I am a little hungry now), of course, this object may also be a robot. If engineers want to connect them to the Internet of Things, they don’t have to develop them from scratch. They just need to add off-the-shelf IoT terminal modules to their appliances (objects) and then operate the module according to a standardized protocol. It can be said that as long as the IoT module is added, this lonely object can use it to talk to other objects that own this module. Because of the unified protocol, they can understand each other’s words, and can easily communicate with other objects to obtain the necessary information, thus saving a lot of trouble. And the Internet of Things module will also provide Internet access to facilitate the acquisition of information by objects. For detailed instructions on how to get information, how to know what information other objects provide, will be discussed in a future article.</p>
<p>Now that this talking object wants to talk to many objects, like humans, they also form a network of relationships to facilitate the exchange of information. The relational network is divided into a public relationship network and a private relationship network. In public relations networks, objects that access this network should follow a common password (the password, see in later articles), and objects can exchange information widely. Because public network access does not require strict security checks like private networks and does not use packets encrypted with private passwords, it can be seen that access to public networks is very convenient, so public networks will become very large. Objects with public service functions are generally connected to the network, such as traffic lights, automatic weather stations, public service robots, buses, etc., so there are many types of information that objects can obtain. For example, my bus stop can be connected to the public network, and it is convenient to obtain weather information from the nearest automatic weather station through the public network, adjust itself within the scope of its existing functions, and provide passengers with more comfortable and environmentally friendly. Car plan. If there are too many passengers in this bus stop and it is raining, the passengers will be sheltered from the rain. The platform can also communicate with the mobile phone that is connected to the public network nearby, telling the person who is using the mobile phone. There are too many people at this station. Come again. When people, people who use mobile phones can also use the contact station to get the information they need. All communication is mainly done by wireless. It is very convenient. The platform has doubts: the coverage of the wireless network is so large. How can I contact people who are several kilometers away? Could it be that I am not equipped with a high-power transmitter? In fact, this is ok, but I have a better solution. In my vision, an object connected to the Internet of Things has to be obligated to have benefits. When the station sends out its information, the object that is connected to the Internet of Things close to him will receive the message. They need to be responsible for forwarding this message and propagating it to other objects in their vicinity. If there are enough objects in the net, the message can be communicated to a farther place. However, this method can not solve all problems. In order to transmit information in time, the platform can directly connect the Internet of Things module to the Internet and tell other objects through the Internet. In fact, in the absence of a way, for example, at the edge of the object, the object can also be wired communication, satellite communication and other means. It’s just that the price will be even greater. It can be said that the communication method of the Internet of Things is very flexible and has the ability to timely convey the information obtained. What’s more, every object in the public network has its own unique code, which is specified at birth, so that objects in the public network can be located to find a certain object. In addition to its own unique code, the object has an identifier called a function identifier. Why do you have this logo? Because other objects are communicating with this object, you need to know what the object is doing.</p>
<p>Let’s take a comprehensive example. For example, a newly bought rice cooker that can talk (connected to the Internet of Things) is unfamiliar and wants to know what can be done by objects next to me. I can let them show their own feature logo, then the rice cooker knows that the benevolent man next to him is a socket and the other is a refrigerator. Obviously, the rice cooker is very interested in the refrigerator. Since he knows that he is a refrigerator, the rice cooker can talk to the refrigerator with his own words. He got the food stored in the refrigerator from the refrigerator, as well as their freshness, price and so on. It looked for ways the engineer told him to go online, and then told the IoT module to use the Internet to find out what to do with the things in those refrigerators. The Internet told him that pork ribs, red rice porridge, mung bean porridge (now I am so hungry) are good. Then he asks himself again, the owner generally likes to eat 啥, from the owner’s mobile phone, the owner is a Jiangxi person, ask the Internet, what Jiangxi people like to eat. Big data, as well as his own intuition (artificial intelligence), told him that ribs and lean meat porridge are good. Then he told the owner’s mobile phone (known with the function logo), recommend the pork porridge to the owner as the breakfast for tomorrow. Ten minutes later, the owner approved its recommendation via mobile phone. At the appropriate time, he told the robots at home to take out the raw materials in the refrigerator, wash the vegetables through the washing machine, wash the rice in the rice machine, cook the meat, and cook the meat in person. The joint efforts of ribs and lean porridge will be done. Waiting for the table, the owner finished eating. The task of the first day of the rice cooker is over. This time he met many partners, thanks to the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>Of course, if the information exchanged by these objects is through the public relations network, it is equivalent to revealing the information of their own home. This is of course not allowed, so we have a private network to protect the privacy and security of our users. I wrote it here first. The next article will detail how the private relationship network works.</p>
